# Face_Detection_with_MultiProcessing

Face detection using OpenCV with haar-like cascade classifier is very common and faster method to implement. But for massive faces in one frame and long videos, it is very time consuming and slow processing.  In this project, we are representing a method for parallel processing for multiple face detection and recognition in images with many faces, long videos, videos with many faces, and real time where images can be obtained from live video and compare the time with single processing. To detect the face in mentioned scenarios, we are using haar-like Cascade Classifier dataset “haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml” which is a xml file with features nodes of frontal face. This dataset is officially provided by OpenCV. For parallelization of the detection of multiple faces, we are using Python multiprocessor to make the training and testing faster. We also compare the execution time with single processor in the mentioned scenario
